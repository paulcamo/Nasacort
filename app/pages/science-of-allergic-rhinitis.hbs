            <h2>Allergic Rhinitis Affects Patients&apos; Quality of Life</h2>
            <p>Allergic rhinitis (AR) is highly prevalent, and is becoming increasingly common in children and adults. Symptoms such as sneezing, rhinorrhea, itchy nose, and nasal congestion have a far-reaching effect on a patient's quality of life.</p>

            <h2>About Allergic Rhinitis</h2>
            <p>Many of your patients have been using oral antihistamines (OAHs) for years, but they continue to suffer with allergic rhinitis (AR), or are looking for something more. <span class="highlighted">These sufferers</span> of moderate to severe nasal allergies may find relief with Nasacort<sup>&reg;</sup> Allergy 24HR—the only unscented OTC INS. But your patients may not fully <span class="highlighted">understand the difference</span> between these 2 separate classes of drugs, OAHs and INSs, or that <span class="highlighted">OTC INSs can differ in their sensory attributes</span> To understand how OAHs work compared with INSs, it may help your patient to learn about the relationship between allergic rhinitis and inflammation.</p>

            <h2>Intranasal Steroids or Antihistamines?</h2>
            <p>As you've seen in your practice, <span class="highlighted">efficacy matters</span> to your allergic rhinitis patients, who get worn down by <span class="highlighted">bothersome symptoms</span> And when it comes to efficacy, nothing is better than an INS.</p>
            <p>According to the latest medical guidelines, intranasal steroids like Nasacort<sup>&reg;</sup> Allergy 24HR are the most effective class of allergy medication.<sup>1</sup> They have a powerful anti-inflammatory agent that stops your patients' <span class="highlighted">worst nasal allergy symptoms</span>, even <span class="highlighted">congestion</span></p>
            <p>For patients who want efficacy for mild to moderate allergic rhinitis symptoms—and don't suffer from nasal congestion—an <span class="highlighted">oral antihistamine</span> (OAH) is a good choice. An OAH can treat the early stage of the allergic cascade (see above). </p>
            <p>Because of its powerful efficacy, an INS is recommended for patients with moderate to severe allergic rhinitis or for treating the full range of nasal allergy symptoms. When it comes to OTC INSs, patients prefer* SCENT-FREE, ALCOHOL-FREE Nasacort<sup>&reg;</sup> Allergy 24HR over Flonase<sup>&reg;</sup>. Compare to see the <span class="highlighted">Nasacort Difference</span></p>
