      <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
      <p>In general, we have designed this website to minimize the amount of personal information collected and request only the information that is required to ensure that visitors can effectively participate in our activities and events. No personal information is collected from visitors to this website unless you provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. On this website, you may be able to enter contests, subscribe to services, or otherwise respond to certain offers and opportunities. In order to accomplish this, it may be necessary for you to voluntarily provide some of the following types of personally identifiable information: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, and information about your interests and use of various products, programs, and services. We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit one of our websites, as part of the standard operation of our server, by using Cookie Technology. This technology does not personally identify you or extract any information from your computer. Rather, Cookie Technology is used to provide an enhanced online experience, to measure and monitor the use of our website, and to improve its design and content. The information this technology collects may include: the name of your Internet service provider, the date and time you accessed the website, the Internet address of the website from which you enter our website and where you go after you leave our website. Data that would personally identify you is known only when voluntarily submitted.</p>
      <h3>How We Use Information</h3>
      <p>If you voluntarily provide us with any requested information, we generally use that information for internal purposes only. For example, we may use this information to communicate directly with you, such as to respond to your inquiries, to inform you when you have won one of our contests, or to offer you additional information about our products, programs, services, promotions, or offers that we believe may be of interest to you. Such responses will include information on how to opt out from receiving further information or services. Certain information we receive online may on occasion be combined with our other records to enhance our ability to market those products or services we believe may be of interest to you. We never sell, rent, or otherwise share any personal information we obtain with third parties, unless we have notified you at an e-mail address you provided that we intend to do so and have provided you with an opportunity to request that we not do so. We may have to disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal requests, for example court orders, subpoenas, or specific requests from law enforcement agencies. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this policy. We have, however, put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to help prevent the unauthorized access and use of the information we collect online.</p>
      <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
      <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have personal information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our systems. Chattem encourages parents to use the internet with their children. To make a child's online experience safer, we recommend that parents teach children never to give personal information, unless supervised by a parent or a responsible adult.</p>
